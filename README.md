## Background

Challenge.gov's Project Management Office (PMO) requires the provision and maintenance of a stable and secure solution that is at once (a) scalable and flexible to meet agency customers’ needs, (b) sustainable in terms of cost, operations/maintenance and support, and (c) able to meet GSA IT’s requirements for software-as-a-service applications. The platform should maintain the Challenge.gov branding, which has become a recognized and trusted source for agency customers and public solvers alike, and provide prominent links out to its other properties, including the Challenges and Prizes Toolkit and PrizeWire blog.
